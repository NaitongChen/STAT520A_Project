\section{Conclusion}

Through the experiments above, we find that the approach in \cite{carlin1992hierarchical} is more favourable in all models that we have tested. Then when the computational cost of evaluating the conditional distribution of the change point locations is not prohibitive, using the Gibbs sampler approach will produce samples that better represent the posterior distributions of the change point locations. However, we note that the approach in \cite{antoch2008application} offers very competitive performance, especially considering only a uniform proposal distribution is used. By designing more informative proposal distribution, as already been explored in \cite{benson2018adaptive}, proposal-based MCMC methods applied to the change point problems would be a very attractive choice when the computational load is too heavy to be handled by the fully Gibbs approach.
